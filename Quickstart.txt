MQTT MOSQUITTO ON WINDOWS
===============================================================
Install: https://mosquitto.org/download/

In MQTT there are a few basic concepts that you need to understand:
    Publish/Subscribe
    Messages
    TopicsThe broker is primarily responsible for receiving all messages, filtering the messages, decide who is interested in them and then publishing the message to all subscribed clients.
    Broker

1.In a publish and subscribe system, a device can publish a message on a topic, or it can be subscribed to a particular topic to receive messages
    For example Device 1 publishes on a topic.
    Device 2 is subscribed to the same topic as device 1 is publishing in.
    So, device 2 receives the message.
2.Messages are the information that you want to exchange between your devices. Whether it’s a command or data
3.Topics are the way you register interest for incoming messages or how you specify where you want to publish the message.
	Topics are represented with strings separated by a forward slash. Each forward slash indicates a topic level. Here’s an example on how you would create a topic for a lamp in your home office:home/office/lamp
	Note: topics are case-sensitive
4.The broker is primarily responsible for receiving all messages, filtering the messages, decide who is interested in them and then publishing the message to all subscribed clients.

Other info:
IPaddress/port
Username/password/ClientID(must be unique)

For quick test, in separate terminal windows do the following:
1.Start the broker:     mosquitto
2.Start the command line subscriber:    mosquitto_sub -v -t test/topic
3.Publish test message with the command line publisher:     mosquitto_pub -t test/topic -m "Local helloWorld"


test with server test.mosquitto.org, in separate terminal windows do the following:
mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -v -t test/topic
mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t test/topic -m "Internet helloWorld"

for subcribe all topic: mosquitto_sub -v -t #
for help: moquitto -h

===============================================================
Running Mosquitto as a Service
Installing Mosquitto as a Service using Power Shell
Open a power shell command prompt as administrator
Change to the directory where you have installed mosquitto and type: ./mosquitto install
Mosquitto is added but you don’t get any confirmation and it isn’t started but will start on reboot. However you can now start it manually.
Now open a normal command prompt again as administrator and type the commands:
sc query mosquitto
sc start mosquitto
sc query mosquitto



mosquitto_sub -h <YourIP> -p 8883 -v -t 'owntracks/#' -u owntracks -P <YourPassword>
